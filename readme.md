# Geocode Sqlite table

This plugin performs bulk geocoding of records in an SQLite table using OSM Nominatim.

## Usage

Select the database file, the table and the field to geocode, 
then press "Start".

Depending on the number of records, processing may take several minutes.

## Known issues:

If there are multiple geocoding results, the first one is used. 
Sometimes this may lead to false geocodes.
